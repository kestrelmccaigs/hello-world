Hello!
Apart from a book my grandpa gave me when I was ten called "1001 Things You Can Do With Your Computer" (which was my go-to when I was bored) and fiddling around with HTML back when MySpace pages were a thing, I don't have much of a background in coding. But I'm here now and I'm loving every frustrating minute of the learning process.
